## Possible approaches to deal with N/A or Nan etc. in data:
1) Drop rows / columns that have missing values (see what percentage of rows are missing)
2) Assume average value (e.g. BMI, temperature)
3) Assume most common label for 'string' labels (e.g. male/female etc.)
4) Make sure you know what NA means --> could be Not applicable, or could indicate that no entry exists
